Q: My MPI Send processes hang after using a dynamically computed reciever, why does this occur?
  
  A:
  When using a dynamically computed reciever in MPI, make sure all processes recieve a message, whether it be a 0 byte message or
  one with relavent data. View the discussion here:

Q: MPI program causes the computation time to increase as more processes are added:

  A:
  There are two reasons for this. First and formost, when designing an MPI program, all tests should be of an adquate size. That is to say,
  the computation time should be in increments of seconds and not miliseconds. Any time values recorded in miliseconds are likely to be affected by
  noise. Moreover, when programming an MPI algorithim, remember that 'while' and for 'loops' will increase the serial computation time of the algorithim;
  therefore reducing the effectiveness of utilizing additional processes. It is recommended that the granuality of the program be observed for
  proper tests.
