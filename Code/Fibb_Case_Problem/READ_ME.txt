The problem statement of the inital case problem is as follows:

""""
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. Compute this solution 100 times using both serial and parallel algorthims. 
Compare the results of CPU % load and computation times to gain a general understanding of MPI coding and parallel algorithims
""""

Note that this GitHub repository will contain three unqiue solutions to this problem. 
A python script (orgionally written in Jupyter Notebooks) is include with statistical data.

A C++ serial solution is also available. This code solves the problem without using MPI code.

A final C++ parallel algorithim is also available. This code solves the problem statement by utiling MPI parallel algorithim comparison. 
The important highlights of this study are included in a brief report (posted in Slack) titled: Week1Summary.
