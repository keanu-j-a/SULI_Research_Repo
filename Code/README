This folder will contain all of the code developed throughout the SULI internship.

The inital case study file contains all of the code pertaining to the Fibonacci sequence opening problem. The purpose of this case problem was to introduce the concept
of MPI coding with C++ and to gather preliminary data on cpu perfomance and computation timing on serial vs. parallel algorithims. The results of this data will be used
as a reference when working with future MOOSE applications.
